# TacoJS

The ultimate taco meetup in Philadelphia


## Budget

Our trusty accountant, Travis CI, is keeping track of our finances. Our ultimate goal is to reach 0 at the end of each meetup, with proceeds donated to a charity. Check out our budget: https://github.com/TacoJS/tacojs.github.io/blob/master/budget.js

- **Passing** = We have a balanced budget, only happens right after a meetup
- **Failing** = We have an unbalanced budget, see budget.js for details
