## About
TacoJS is a monthly meetup centered around programming, tacos, and karaoke. It started when X and Y went to BrooklynJS. They were inspired by the event and wanted to organize a Bay Area technology meetup that would do these things:

- Have attendees actually meet and talk to one another.
- Promote a diverse and inclusive environment.
- Get people to have fun.

Today the meetup is co-organized by X, Y, and Z. It’s held at X Food Park every Y of the month.

## Sponsorship Packages
Coming Soon!

During the event, sponsors have a chance to talk to attendees in a casual setting. Here are some other things you get with your sponsorship:

- **Stage time**: Two minutes of stage time to do whatever you want with (the more creative the better).
- **Free tickets**: Two tickets for people at your company (please, no recruiters).
- **Swag and merch**: Place to put stickers and swag on the check-in desk or on tables around the venue.
- **Branding**: Featured in the emails to the attendees and shown on TacoJS.com.
- **Opt-in email list**: We ask all attendees whether they’d like to be contacted by sponsors. We’ll share the contact information of those (and only those) who have opted in.
<!-- - **Brunch**: Every three months, we invite sponsors, speakers and performers to have brunch together. -->

## History
The first session was in July 2016 and it has been held monthly ever since. We use funds to cover the cost of food, the venue, and equipment. We donate all unused funds each month to non-profits such as Coded by Kids, Hopeworks, Code for Philly, StudentRND, and GirlDevelopIt.

## Speakers & Attendees
Our past speakers have worked as developers at established companies, as well as smaller startups. Here are a few of those companies:

- Automattic
- Comcast
- Zivtech

<!-- Our attendees are roughly the same ratio of people from larger and smaller companies, leaning toward smaller startups. Around 35% of our attendees are women. -->

## Diversity
We believe this industry can and should be more inclusive. Here are the things we do to make that happen:

- **Donations**: We donate all proceeds to non-profits such as Girls Who Code and Black Girls Code.
- **Student sponsorships**: We sponsor students to come to the event so they can meet more people in the industry. So far, we’ve had students from High School, Penn, Temple, and NY Code &amp; Design Academy.
- **Diverse speakers**: We make sure that we have a wide range of speakers at each of our events, with an eye toward gender, racial, and socioeconomic diversity.
